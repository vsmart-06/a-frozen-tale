## Part 1: The Song

At the beginning of the movie Frozen, Anna asked Elsa to play with her through the iconic **Do you want to build a snowman?** song. Let's try to fulfill Anna's dream ourselves, even though she could not!

### ***Do you want to build a snowman?***

Although Anna didn't get to build a snowman with Elsa (apart from Olaf), what's stopping you? Use the command `/snowman build` to build your own snowman! Preserve your snowman by clicking the **Favourite** button so that you can call it whenever you want with the command `/snowman favourite`!

**Note**: All details of the snowman can be edited individually or in a group without affecting the others

### ***Come on let's go and play!***

At the same time, Elsa also sadly refused to play with Anna, but you can still play with your friends! Use the commands `/snowball load` and `/snowball throw` to have a snowball fight with your friends in your server! Use the command `/snowball leaderboard` to view your server leaderboard in the game! You can also view your own statistics with the command `/snowball profile`!

A few points to remember:
- You can only load a maximum of 2 snowballs at a time
- You have to wait for 30 seconds between loading snowballs
- When you get hit by a snowball, you lose all your current snowballs and you have to wait for 30 seconds till you can load another one

## Part 2: The Quest

After Elsa's powers are revealed to everyone in Arendelle, Anna resolves to go on a mission to retrieve her sister. During the course of this journey, Anna, accompanied by Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven, faced many difficulties to reach her Elsa's castle.

To replicate the hardships of this journey, you will be tasked with answering a series of questions to defrost the path and reach the castle, and get Elsa back to Arendelle! Use the command `/quest new` to begin your journey! View your quest statistics with the command `/quest profile`!

## Part 3: Saving Elsa

Once Anna reaches Elsa's palace, she attempts to convince Elsa to return to Arendelle. This was to no avail, as Elsa refused to return. In the argument that ensued, Elsa accidentally freezes Anna's heart, but then forces Anna, Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven to leave. As the movie carries on, we eventually land back in Arendelle, where Elsa and Hans are having an intense battle, and Hans lies to Elsa telling that she had killed Anna. This leaves Elsa devastated, and Hans raises his sword to kill her. However, Anna manages to run in and stop Hans's blade as she turns to ice. Elsa then starts crying and hugging Anna, and this act of true love manages to bring Anna back to life, and she manages to reel her powers in, and return Arendelle to normality.

To complete your frozen journey, you must now go on a path created to replicate Anna's journey to save Elsa. You must traverse the path within 30 seconds, otherwise you will be too late to save Elsa from Hans! Follow the arrows exactly to reach the two of them. Use the command `/save elsa` to begin! The clock is ticking!
